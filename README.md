# Rubiks-Cube-Solver
My attempt at a 3x3 Rubik's Cube Solver

Designed so that all moves are based on Blue on the front side and Yellow on top. Also, all moves are clockwise unless noted as ', in which case it is counterclockwise (i.e. B' = Back Prime = Turn the back (Green) side counterclockwise; L = Left = Turn the left side (Orange) side clockwise)

U = Up (Yellow)
R = Right (Red)
F = Front (Blue)
D = Down (White)
L = Left (Orange)
B = Back (Green)

When entering cube pieces' colors, enter exactly either "Yellow", "Orange", "Blue", "Red", "Green", or "White" (without the quotation marks; case-sensitive). I haven't implemented any real checks that the inputted cube is possible (or that the inputted colors are in the cases that work for the code), so if you enter in wrong information you will have to redo the entire process. 

Download the three .py files and run "Cube.py" to use.
